			<p>As enterprises embrace the cloud, their infrastructure and applications have shifted from static systems into rapidly changing services. A large enterprise must make a continuous series of changes to its networks, servers and applications – upgrades, patches, firmware updates, new configurations, and deployments – every single day.
			chef-cloudBecause businesses are racing to shorten the time from idea to va lue, Chef has distilled its strength in high-velocity IT into a new product for the software-driven enterprise. Built on Chef’s IT automation platform, Chef Delivery uses a unified process to automate changes to infrastructure, runtime environments and applications at the same time.
			Chef Delivery would provide a robust framework for automated testing, continuous in/ptegration and continuous delivery. It extends the Chef platform currently used by hundreds of enterprises worldwide, including Bloomberg, Disney, Facebook, GE Capital, Intuit, Nordstrom, Standard Bank, Target, and Yahoo.
			Chef Delivery is currently available through an invitation program. The product will be sold in 2015 on a subscription basis. General availability is planned in early 2016.
			This week, thousands of developers and IT leaders convene at ChefConf 2015, both on-site and via live-stream. Here, the company also unveiled that average revenue per new customer increased over 200 percent year-over-year in Q4 2014.</p>
