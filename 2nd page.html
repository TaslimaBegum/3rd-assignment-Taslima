			<p>ServerMonkey buys and sells new and refurbished servers and networking equipment. After a successful first four years, the company will continue to offer new and refurbished IT hardware and asset disposition services to domestic and international markets.
			The company’s Sales, Supply Chain, Web Development and Marketing have all been expanded in an open concept plan with additional room for growth. The new space also includes a professional photography studio for product staging and photos.
			Other improvements to the space include a large conference room, 6 new offices, a data center, and a large break room for company meetings and events. The complete campus now has secured wireless access for in-house and guest users. ServerMonkey is also expanding and reorganizing the operations area and warehouse which is expected to be complete by the end of Q2 this year.
			“The new expansion and added capabilities align with ServerMonkey’s vision of growth for the company,” said Layla Wright, CEO of ServerMonkey. “We will continue to expand our facilities and increase our personnel in order to support the needs of our customers.”</p>
